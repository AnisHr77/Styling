# Hosting 

https://684e1e74ffd5146eaaa465f8--imaginative-druid-d82bdd.netlify.app/

This repository is a personal project where I experiment with **Tailwind CSS styling**, test **responsive designs**, and recall some utility classes that I tend to forget. It serves as a visual and responsive playground.

### ⚙️ What This Project Is About

- Practicing Tailwind CSS properties and layout techniques
- Building responsive UI components
- Simulating a hosting website style (like Hostinger)

### 🧪 Note

This is **not yet a functional app** — just static styling for now. But my goal is to turn it into a real project with dynamic features in the future.

### 🤝 Looking for Collaborators

I’d love to collaborate with others who are passionate about UI/UX, Tailwind CSS, or frontend development in general. Feel free to fork, open issues, or send PRs if you’re interested in helping build this into something bigger!
I will be So happy if you want to collaborate with me in this products once I find some Collaborators  I'll keep working on this Project So don't hesitate to Contact me !
